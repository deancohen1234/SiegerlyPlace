# SiegerlyPlace

This was a semester long project that required our team of 3 people to create a game with AI and multiplayer functionality. Our idea was create a simple first person shooter from scratch, and have a networked game mode with two teams. For future developments we are hoping to add custom effects for shooting and have character classes, but for now it was a prototype for us to see how Unreal and C++ work!
